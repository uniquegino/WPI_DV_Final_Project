# The U.S. Election throughout History


## Overview
This is a final project of WPI's class CS573 Data Visualization.

In this project, we attempt to show the evolution of the two-party system across the country, since 1920.

## Demo
create a two minute screen-cast with narration showing a demo of your visualization and/or some slides.


## Description
- Demo Wrap-up

The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.


- Data

  * [Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections](http://uselectionatlas.org/), which is our main data source that includes the voting statistics for every election by state level
  * [American Presidency Project: Presidential Election Data](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/elections.php), from which we grabbed the financial data (Federal Budget Receipts & Outlays, and GDP)
  * [Newspaper presidential endorsements](http://noahveltman.com/endorsements/), where we excerpted the endorsement of top 10 US newspapers (by circulation)


- Code Structure

Generally speaking, `Utils` includes the interaction code and `Chart` includes all the static charts; with `run()` function, they could be connected and executed together.

For the detailed actions and charts involved in this project, please find the process book and the code for reference.


- Library

`D3.js` is the only library we leveraged for this project.
